Create gists from the command line and track them with git.

** Usage

Create a gist from files =a.txt= and =src/b.txt= with a description clone
the result into =/tmp/mygist=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
giz create -o /tmp/mygist -d "my gist description" ./a.txt ./src/b.txt
#+END_SRC

** Installation

*** Using ~nix-env~

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix-env -i -f https://github.com/thalesmg/giz/archive/master.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

*** Simple link

(here, it is assumed that =/home/user/bin= in the current user's PATH)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix build .
ln -sf $PWD/result/bin/giz /home/user/bin/giz
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

Create a =config.json= file at =XDG_CONFIG_HOME/giz= (or
=$HOME/.config/giz=) with the path that [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][=pass=]] will use to get yout
Github personal access token (PAT). This PAT must have at least the
=gist= scope.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "pass-path": "github.com/tokens/giz-token"
}
#+END_SRC

Or else pass that path as an argument with =--pass-path=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
giz create --pass-path "github.com/tokens/giz-token" -o /tmp/mygist a.txt
#+END_SRC
